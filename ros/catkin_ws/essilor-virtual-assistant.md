# Introduction
* This document describes on-shop virtual-assistant-software module list and development plan.
* A Essilor virtual assistant (LUXILOR) is a conversational, gesture, touch, computer-generated character that simulates a conversation to deliver voice, media(rich contents) or text-based information to a customer via kiosk interface.
* The virtual assistant uses AI-powered voice biometrics and face recognition to confirm the identity of the customers by the sound of their voice and/or their face.
* The virtual assistant  incorporates speech recognition for natural-language processing, dialogue control, domain knowledge and a visual appearance (such as avatar animation) that changes according to the content and context of the dialogue. 
* The virtual assistant is not designed or intended to replace human beings, which helps to contribute to his integration.

# High-Level User Scenarios

## Open Box
* Kiosk app say hello to the world and guide the user to setup configuration
* User connect to virtual assistant via WiFi configurations to Essilor-virtual assistant_optician_assistant

## Auto-Upgrade OTA(over the air)
* virtual assistant automatically check for latest updates and download firmware in background
* When firmware downloaded, prompt messages to user to confirm the upgrade execution

## Open Box App
* Open Box app on kiosk

## Auto-Upgrade OTA 
* Remotely auto-upgrade app on Kiosk
* Each virtual assistant will be assigned an unique "virtual assistantId"
* Upgrade by specified "virtual assistantId"

# System Architecture
* Here is the proposed system architecture: 
* All the intelligent modules will be on kiosk board.

# Software Modules to be developed
## Server Backend. FullRest API for business logic. Digital signage management and Business intelligence.
* Node.js 
* Express 
* MongoDB

## App for user interface & rich user experience. Vision test, optician assistant, informing and recommending product, virtual reality, varilux x series, etc
 * Node.js
 * Html5, CSS3 and JavaScript. Angular.js and React.js
 
## Speech Interactions Options (This is something like "Siri")
 
### Speech Interactions with node.js
* https://syl22-00.github.io/pocketsphinx.js/

### Speech Interactions with Echo Alexa - Amazon
* Echo Alexa
* We can leverage several amazon's services
 * https://developer.amazon.com/alexa-voice-service

### Speech Interactions with Google
* We can leverage several Android's services
 * https://developer.android.com/reference/android/service/voice/VoiceInteractionService.html
 * http://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/SpeechRecognizer.html
* Full speech conversation is too difficult. Instead, we can go dialog-based and retrieve limited commands by keywords 
 * We can leverage Android's TextToSpeech service 
 * Refer to: http://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/tts/TextToSpeech.html


## Computer Vision and Object Recognition
* The virtual assistant should be able to recognized "who" so that it can try to close to the "right" person.
* We can leverage OpenCV template matching by present face images
 * Refer to: http://docs.opencv.org/doc/tutorials/imgproc/histograms/template_matching/template_matching.html
* Must be able to measure relative positions between the customer and the virtual assistant kiosk.
